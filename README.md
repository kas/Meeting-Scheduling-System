# Introduction
I was tasked to create a meeting scheduling system using Java Swing and NetBeans IDE for my final project in my Computer Science 221 class (Fall 2015).  I utilized object-oriented programming principles in this project.  Most other students in the class were using simple JList objects to list each room/meeting/person.  I wanted my project to have a more ergonomic feel to it so I learned how to dynamically use frames with Swing.  I believe that this approach makes my program more user friendly.

I recieved a 95% on the project, and my professor was impressed with the design approach I used.

# Basic Overview
The user is greeted with a window listing the rooms available.  The user can add rooms individually or by specifying a number of rooms to add.  The rooms will be added as blocks on the window.  If the user clicks a room block, a window appears showing the meetings for that room.  This screams to the user that object-oriented principles were used.  The user can add meetings to the room and people to those meetings in the same matter.  If the user wants to save the current rooms, they can go back to the rooms window and click menu.  In the menu window that pops up, the user can open and save the serialized file containing rooms.  In that menu the user can also view meetings with the buttons designated to search for meetings.
