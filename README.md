#Introduction
I was tasked to create a meeting scheduling system using Java Swing and NetBeans IDE for my final project in my Computer Science 221 class (Fall 2015).  I utilized object-oriented programming principles in this project.  Most other students in the class were using simple JList objects to list each room/meeting/person.  I wanted my project to have a more ergonomic feel to it so I learned how to dynamically use frames with Swing.  I believe that this approach makes my program more user friendly.

I recieved a 95% on the project, and my professor was impressed with the design approach I took.
